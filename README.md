Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮

This is a simple and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:

- Clean and responsive UI design

Technologies Used:

How It Works:
1. Player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. Computer randomly generates its move.
3. Winner is determined using conditional logic.
4. Scores update automatically on the scoreboard.
5. Game continues until reset.
